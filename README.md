masterthesis
============

The purpose of this master thesis is to develop a method for temperature compensation in
industrial measurement. The main focus and area of application is the compensation of
the thermal expansion of the part object.
The fundamental of the developed method is a compilation of modern and commercial
methods and software solutions for temperature compensation used for this task. Based
on this, criterias for the new method are determined and considered in the development
of the method.
Other than the modern state of the art procedures, the here presented method for temperature compensation works different. The compensation of the measurement is not applied
in direction of the origin of the part coordinate system, but in the direction of a newly
developed origin of expansion that has to be determined.
As part of the master thesis, two procedures are developed that can be used to compensate
the influence of the temperature. One procedure can capture the expansion of the part
object by measuring the part temperature. In this procedure you also need to know the
coefficient of thermal expansion of the part object. The other procedure can capture and
compensate the expansion by applying a spatial transformation.
The methods and the software solution OpenIndy is open- source, what allows an insight
in the algorithms. This leads in a transparency of the methods, that can also be adjusted
for some special cases.
